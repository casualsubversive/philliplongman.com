    <p>They call it a church without walls, but it’s really a church without a ceiling.</p>
    
    <p>They meet in the courtyard behind the Historical Museum.  The buildings around them make excellent walls—the yellow stone of the museum on one side, cold cement on the other, with ivy clinging to the bottom.  A gazebo, with its graceful point, serves as both pulpit and steeple.  People mill around a line for coffee and tea, talking and laughing.  The sound guy is checking the speakers and mic.  Others are finishing the setup for the fellowship meal afterwards.  Things are running late because they forgot the ladles.  It’s really just like a church.  But there’s no ceiling.</p>
    
    <p>It’s an important point, because most of the congregants of Church on the Street are homeless or on the edge of homelessness.  Walls abound for them, but there aren’t enough ceilings.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>I heard about Church on the Street through my friend, Brenna Powers.  Brenna has been the church’s main pastor since it’s founder, Mike Young, died of cancer a year ago.  I interview her and another acquaintance, Cliff Bragg, an assistant pastor, at the Donut Whole, where we discuss the destitute and the hollowness of the modern church experience over donuts.  Writing about the homeless is apparently replete with symbolism and pathetic fallacy.</p>
    
    <p>They fill me in.  Young and others created Church on the Street to minister to the people on the margins in Wichita.  They meet every Sunday at 12:30 in Heritage Park, even in the foulest weather.  As much as 90 percent of the churchgoers are people in physical need.  They come for the human fellowship, the spiritual message, and the free lunch and hot coffee provided.  Brenna and Cliff are quick to explain that it’s a <em>church,</em> not a charity.  It’s a spiritual community seeking to follow the example of Jesus by living among those who need help the most.</p>
    
    <p>“It’s a church that fills the needs of its congregants.  Like any church does,” Brenna explains.  “No one who goes there consistently, goes there to get their feeling of charity.  Maybe initially, but not anymore.”</p>
    
    <p>Cliff goes on, “It’s not like the Lord’s Diner, where people volunteer to come help for a week.  We want people to come in and get involved—establish roots, grow deep.  And in the process you serve each other.  So you’re not serving the homeless, you’re serving each other.  So it might be that there’s a homeless person in line one day serving <em>us</em>.”</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>I go three times, and each time the weather gets worse.  The first Sunday, there’s a lot of snow on the ground, but the air feels like spring.  A family with several younger children is shoveling some of the slush away.  Purple buds peek through the snow melting snow on the trees.  Water is dripping everywhere, and I’m wearing too many layers.</p>
    
    <p>Someone greets me right away when they notice my notepad, and before long, I’m sipping carefully from a styrofoam cup of scalding tea, while Brenna and Cliff introduce me people.  They’re setting up the food line to my right—ham and beans.  After a brief service, everyone will dig in.  “We keep it very short because we know how hungry they are,” Cliff tells me.</p>
    
    <p>I’ve come on an unusual day.  Cliff is going to talk to the church about some problems that have been brewing.  There’s been some normal church acrimony developing—judging and bickering—and some problems that spring from the unusual demographic—threats and under-the-radar dealing.  This is especially worrying.  The police have been very respectful of the church, but that won’t last if they start getting called in to deal with drug sales and brawls.</p>
    
    <p>“I’m not coming here to condemn anyone.  I’m standing here because I love you <em>so much</em>.  I’m not standing here in the snow for my own health.  I come here because I love you <em>so much,</em>” Cliff tells the crowd.  “You were beautifully and wonderfully made by God.  I don’t care what anyone says.”</p>
    
    <p>He’s standing on the steps of the gazebo, talking to a loose assemblage of about 50 people.  “I’m going to establish right now, if it hasn’t been done before, that <em>this is church.</em> This is not a park.  For two hours, every Sunday from now on, this is church.”  There are people in nice clothes (many of whom are homeless) and rags.  I see a man in a suit, people in jeans, men in layered sweatshirts underneath filthy coveralls, and a girl in boots that are not practical for snow.</p>
    
    <p>“This place is holy.  And by holy I don’t mean sinless!  I don’t mean struggle-less!  I don’t mean that people come in here and have their crap together!  That means people come in here who are like me who know that they are so messed up that they need something bigger than them to help.  They know that they can’t do it on their own.”  There are people of every skin tone.  Adults and children.  The diverse crowd and the message of love could be a touching TV moment if the real need in these people wasn’t so raw.</p>
    
    <p>“This is one of the easier ministries I’ve been a part of, because no one is hiding their brokenness,” Brenna tells me.  “Any love is falling on a very hungry soul.”</p>
    
    <p>Cliff wraps up a moving sermon—“God loves us.  And I think that’s good enough”—and the downtown bells go off with magic timing.  Normally they are not so lucky.  Everyone moves on to the ham and beans.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>“You know how some people are livin’ for Friday?  It’s the end of the workweek, and they can’t wait till Friday.  <em>We</em> can’t wait till 12:30 on Sunday.  And we live our week that way.  This started Friday about noon—the cooking.”</p>
    
    <p>I’m talking to Stubby, a board member of Church on the Street.  He’s also the president of the local chapter of the Diakonos Brotherhood, a group that’s integral to the church.  They’re a motorcycle ministry made up of born-again broken souls.  There are five guys in the Wichita chapter, four of whom are recovering addicts.  They wear black leather vests with Jolly Roger patches and answer to names like Sweat Hog and Hollywood.  “They’ve all been to hell and back,” Brenna tells me.</p>
    
    <p>“One person you can reach and keep from being hungry tonight, or take somebody to treatment and have them not go to sleep fucked up or drunk—it’s all worth it,” Sweat Hog tells me.  “Save one human being, that’s what it’s about for us.”</p>
    
    <p>The brothers were doing this kind of work before Church on the Street came along.  After they connected  with the church, they jumped right in to help.  They drive around a rebuilt school bus full of clothes and supplies—the Cool Bus.  Barrels of clothes get set up on the sidewalk outside the park, and people can look through and take what they need.  Once a month they do the cooking and Roger, their chaplain, does the message.  “It just takes the load off Church on the Street,” Stubby says.</p>
    
    <p>Crucially, their attitude helps make the church approachable.  It’s easy to see that guys like them wouldn’t be involved with a group of holier-than-thou prigs.  That’s important to Stubby.</p>
    
    <p>“You know, I’m a recovering addict.  I’ve been clean 17 years.  Up to that point, never did anybody approach me in this fashion.  And it makes me think, I could have saved myself years of misery had somebody done that—even planted a little seed.”</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>It’s Diakonos’ Sunday this week.  Palm Sunday.  I just came from my church’s service, and the contrast is stark.  The wind is biting cold, and by the time I leave, my toes will be numb.  There are no children waving palm leaves, only naked branches on the trees in the courtyard.  I left a special cantata service early to meet Marc, my photographer.  We sit in his car until it’s time to face the wind.</p>
    
    <p>Marc sets off photographing everything while I talk to people.  They’re unloading a large cross from the Cool Bus.  Roger made it this week, and the plan is for one of them to stand holding it up it in the middle of the courtyard every Sunday.  Marc and I observe a wonderful, postmodern occurrence.  A Hispanic man (brown like Jesus) takes it from them and, unselfconsciously Christlike, bears it on his shoulder to it’s own Calvary, mercifully nearby.  Marc discovers his name is Cruz (Cross).</p>
    
    <p>It turns out that the Diakonos brothers are champion barbecuers.  Everyone eats the best barbecued chicken I’ve ever tasted.</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>I ask Cliff and Brenna whether they consider the Church on the Street a part of the Emerging Church movement—a general trend among younger Christians to move away from traditional church institutions toward a more forgiving, practical theology and social justice concerns.  Cliff is quick to dismiss affiliation.  “No, not at all.  No way.  We’re not trying to be a part of any church movement.”</p>
    
    <p>“We’re not a movement, we’re not a charity, we’re not an organization, we’re not trying to pioneer anything.  We’re not trying to <em>do </em>anything.  We’re just living life.  And we happen to do that with people who have been abandoned or happen to be neglected,” he tells me.  “When Jesus was alive, he just lived among who he was around.  Nothing profound about that, except that we happen to be doing it with a group of people who have been marginalized.  No one pays attention to them except when it’s charitable.”</p>
    
    <p>I have to laugh to myself, because Cliff and Brenna have been rattling off points from the emerging church manifesto the entire interview.  Defining the church as a fellowship of people, not a building; living <em>within</em> the world; focusing on physical needs before spiritual ones; shunning hierarchy—from my outsider’s perspective their group is textbook emerging church.</p>
    
    <p>It reminds me of the Absurdist playwrights:  Brilliant playwrights working independently, all exploring similar themes, using similar forms.  Added together, their work was the most important movement of the 20th century.  But when someone first noticed the similarity and named the trend, they all flatly denied being Absurdists.  They said they weren’t interested in being part of any Movement.</p>
    
    <p>I point out to Cliff that they needn’t be part of an organized faction to be part of a larger trend.  “Okay,” he says.  “So what?  Are you gonna pick up a spoon and help serve or what?  I don’t think any of us care.”</p>
    <h4 style="text-align: center;">* * *</h4>
    <p>Easter is both cold <em>and</em> wet.  The rain keeps people away.  Everyone who does show up huddles around the gazebo to keep dry.  At the moment this gazebo is all the building they have.  They’d like to find something—they’re getting more food donations, and they don’t have anywhere to put them—but they’re leery of a mortgage.  They want people who donate money to know it’s all going to the needy and not to pay for some building.</p>
    
    <p>“We’re kind of hoping that someone will give us one,” says Brenna.</p>
    
    <p>They do dream about opening a shelter, where they can have Bible studies, and showers, and kitchens, and a hostel-type setup for people to help take care of themselves.  “That’s why we’re maybe even looking for a place that’s run down, so that it can be a community project, where the homeless can come fix it up and say, ‘Look what we’ve done. This is our sanctuary.’ That’s our dream.”</p>
    
    <p>Worship will always take place outside, though—or at least, huddled under the gazebo.  In the meantime, they’re focusing on bringing people into the embrace of their spiritual family.  When Mike Young was grooming Brenna to take his place, he told her, “All it takes is compassion.  You start from that.”</p>
    
    <p>Her spirits cheerful, despite losing her prepared message to a puddle, Brenna delivers an Easter sermon that speaks to her family’s world—about a Jesus who people wouldn’t see because he wasn’t mighty.  About a God who cares about people’s hearts, not their clothing or possessions.</p>
