You walk into the Apple Store and look around for some help. You know you want a new laptop, but you’re not sure whether you need the cute, little one or if you need to spring for the big, powerful one. Suddenly a large glass panel on your left flickers to life. A translucent girl in hipster glasses and an Apple Genius t-shirt says “Hi, there!” and beckons you over. Intrigued—she’s pretty cute for a digital projection—you step over to the glass.

“Welcome to Apple. I’m Lisa, the automated concierge agent. What can I help you with today? Do you need to make an appointment for help at the Genius bar? Or would you like me to help you find a new Mac or iPod? Or I could call over a sales clerk to help you.” She spreads her hands in front of her and the options she mentioned appear as text floating in front of her. “Just point at what you need.”

You point at the option that says “Shop for Laptops” hovering over her front. The menu disappears and leaves you pointing at her breasts. “Watch where you’re pointing,” she says with a wink, “My iMacs are up here! I can show you any of these laptops, or I can ask you some questions to help you figure out which one is right for you.” As the latest MacBook models appear floating beside her, you think to yourself—is the computer flirting with me?

Welcome to the future of retail. (It’s a utopian future. That’s why we finally have an Apple Store.)

It sounds like a scene from <em>Minority Report</em>, with interactive advertisements calling your name and talking to you about your last purchase. But the technology for automated sales kiosks already exists and sees limited use in Europe and Asia. Now IMG is trying to make it take off in the US.

<em>NakedCity</em> took a tour of the IMG offices in Old Town and got to play with the model they use to demonstrate at conventions and have had on display at Final Friday events.

It’s simple, really. Instead of an expensive and fragile touchscreen, an image is projected onto an ordinary sheet of glass. A bar overhead runs the length of the glass and uses cameras to track your hand movement. You don’t touch the screen—it wouldn’t do any good anyway, it’s just glass—you gesture in the air, and the cameras interpret to move a virtual mouse.

IMG is the sole US importer of the tracking bar, and they’ve developed the kiosk setup we played with for clients. But the hardware isn’t the story, and it isn’t what really gets them really excited. Merely pointing at a screen is a flashy trick that will get this technology noticed. But there’s nothing amazing you can do with gestures that you couldn’t do similarly with a touchscreen or a mouse. The software is just interactive video and Flash like you use on websites. You’re moving a “mouse” with your finger.

The groundbreaking idea here—the thing that’s really going to impact your life—is the content of the programs being run. It’s putting interactive computers, with human faces on them, into your daily life. Within 10 years, advertisements will call out to you on the street. Your bathroom mirror will light up with weather reports and morning news, just like JARVIS in <em>Iron Man</em>. When you get lost in the mall, an interactive map will lead you to the food court. And Lisa will help you decide that the entry level MacBook is powerful enough for you after all, saving you $600.

And IMG will be the ones giving these digital people faces and personality.
