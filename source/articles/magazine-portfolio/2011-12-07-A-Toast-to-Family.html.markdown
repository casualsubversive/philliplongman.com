There’s no better time to eat, drink, and be merry than Thanksgiving—provided you can get past the family histrionics. We think that’s where the drinking comes in. So ditch the cranberry sauce and get yourself through the holidays with this tart, cran-apple martini guaranteed to loosen those sour faces.  We got it from the authors of <em>Sexy City Cocktails</em>. They call it a Pilgrim’s Progress.

Get your martini shaker and fill it with ice. Now pour in the vodka, sour apple liqueur, and cranberry juice. Shake that thing like the Mayflower on the stormy Atlantic and strain the passengers into a cinnamon-rimmed cocktail glass. Garnish with a green apple slice and serve. Repeat until you are cranberry <em>sauced</em>.

Now banish the kids to the basement, gather the grownups around the television, turn on the parade, and hand them all one of these treats. Let it sink in for a few minutes, and then ask what everyone is thankful for. If this drink makes them forget your mother-in-law’s constant stream of criticism for a while, it just might be you.
