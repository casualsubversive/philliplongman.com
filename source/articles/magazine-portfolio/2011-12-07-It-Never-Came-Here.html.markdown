<em>"It Never Came Here" was a short-lived column with the goal of boosting Wichitans' exposure to indie cinema and art films.</em>

<h1>Brick</h1>

Film is the most accessible art-form of the 21st century, and we’re letting ourselves get left in the prairie dust.  So, we at <em>NakedCity</em> are dedicated to providing you with this monthly session of indie indoctrination:

We don’t live in an artistic wasteland.  Wichita gets prestigious art titles like <em>There Will Be Blood </em>and <em>Atonement. </em>But there are so many other brilliant movies that never come here.  They don’t have big-name production companies behind them, or Oscar-level attention.  They’re made on shoestring budgets by directors who have to fight hard to get their vision made.  Its hard for these films to get mainstream distribution—if they play here at all, its a blip at the Palace Premier—so we want to bring them to your attention.

This month, we want you to watch <em>Brick</em>, the stunning feature-debut of writer-director Rian Johnson.  The 2005 Sundance Special Jury Prize winner is a mashup of two well-worn genres; it’s a film noir that takes place in a Southern California high school.  Think, “Down these mean halls must walk a senior who is not himself mean.”  Raymond Chandler does <em>The Breakfast Club</em>.

Tough loner Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is frantically contacted by his ex-girlfriend (Emilie de Ravin).  She left him for the wrong crowd, and now she’s in trouble.  Big trouble.  She mentions the word brick, but before she can say what’s wrong, she hangs up in a panic.  Brendan sets out to find her, and before long he does—face down in a drainage tunnel.

So, like Sam Spade, he sets out to delve the sticky details of who and why, striding deep into the sewage and taking more and more physical punishment the closer he gets to justice.

It could be ridiculous, but it’s riveting.  All the usual noir roles are there in ways we’ve never seen before.  Brendan’s legman is the school nerd, “Brain” (Matt O'Leary).  There are femme fatales—the rich and beautiful head cheerleader (Nora Zehetner) and the seductive drama queen (Meagan Good)—and the weak-willed men they use—the quarterback and the punk stoner.  There’s a goth drug lord, “The ‘Pin” (Lukas Haas), and his poorly controlled muscle (Noah Fleiss).

The movie has a hyper-real quality to it.  When you’re in high school, your trivial problems seem this serious.  Fitting in is a matter of life and death.  Johnson takes the juxtaposition seriously, and that’s why it works.  It never delves into shtick.  Gordon-Levitt manages to sound tough delivering gems like, “Still picking your teeth with freshmen?” and “She knows where I eat lunch.”  He gets beaten as hard as Bogart or Nicholson.  The ending is <em>The Maltese Falcon </em>on a football field.

It’s not a perfect film.  The dialogue is peppered with 1940s crime slang.  It enhances the effect most of the time, but sometimes it’s a little alienating.  Between the slang and the muddy sound quality, you may find the dialogue hard to understand at times.  Don’t stress out—like most mysteries, the plot loops around like a stunt pilot on hallucinogins.  Noir is about the experience.

Now go experience it.
