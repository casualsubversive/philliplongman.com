People judge you by the books you read.  Especially that girl you just brought back to your room.  One look at your back collection of <em>Maxim</em>, <em>The Game</em>, and your World of Warcraft strategy guides and the liaison is over.  You could man up and get some class—you know, expand your horizons by reading something worthwhile.  Or you could hide your real bibliography and buy a bunch of used books to pretend you have an actual personality.  We hunted through Book-a-holic to find three ready-made collections for you.

<h4>THE READER</h4>
You’re so brainy and sardonic.  You could talk for hours about the history of literature and the Enlightenment.  Obviously you know about stuff like wine and art and politics.

She sees <em>Candid</em> and Emerson and Melville on your shelf and knows that you’re an intellectual heavy hitter—all <em>she</em> knows about <em>Moby Dick</em> is “Call me Ishmael.”  <em>A Vindication of the Rights of Women</em> reveals that you’re concerned about philosophical issues like equality and social justice.  Try wearing a “This Is What A Feminist Looks Like” t-shirt.

<strong>The book that makes you approachable:</strong> <em>Candy Girl</em>, the autobiography of Diablo Cody, former stripper and the screenwriter of Juno.  “Oh good,” she thinks. “We liked the same movie!  I must be smart, too.  And if he likes strippers…”

<strong>Your go-to move:</strong> Russian lit.  Get a couple classics in Cyrillic.  Then memorize some sexy phrases in Russian so you can pretend you studied it when she asks.  Tell her, “Anyone can study French.”
<h4>THE POET</h4>
Oh! Your passion burns like fire!  The feeble shell of your body just can’t contain all the art that’s inside you.  Poetry is in your soul.  You read Shakespeare and do theater.  You like artsy, French New Wave movies.  You fill up notebook after notebook with your deep thoughts and poetry.  You listen to bands so cool that no one in Wichita has heard of them.

Plays and books on theater tell about your life on the stage.  Poetry and epics reveal your romantic soul.  Make sure to have PBR or absinthe on hand.  Try to hide anything that looks too expensive.

<strong>The book that makes you approachable:</strong> <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>.  It’s nostalgic because she read it as a child.  It’s not poetic or dramatic.  It’s just silly with red state values.

<strong>Your go-to move:</strong> Poetry, dummy—read her poetry!  Bookmark something romantic or sensual, and be as earnest as you can.  Try some Pablo Neruda or be daring and go straight for “To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time.”  Gather ye rosebuds while ye may…
<h4>THE GURU</h4>
You are an enlightened soul.  A feather floating on the eddies of the cosmic current.  You see the light of the divine in all things, and you yearn to share your love.  You must do yoga and love things like green tea, vegan cooking, and farmer’s markets.

Zen classics tell her about your search for inner truth in a world of suffering.  Books on Western philosophy let her know your wisdom isn’t merely limited to the East.  Don’t forget the incense.

<strong>The book that makes you approachable:</strong> <em>The Tao of Pooh</em>. Winnie the Pooh as a metaphor for The Way?  Clearly you have a sense of humor.

<strong>Your go to move:</strong> Tantric sex books.  Find an old copy of the <em>Kama Sutra</em>.  Leave <em>Tantric Awakening</em> lying around.  Bookmark a particularly intense passage with a post-it note.  Then let her propose trying some of it out.  A good Buddhist knows that chasing after desire only leads to suffering.
